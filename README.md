# initforthe
skills test

I am learning to use git and rails and will be using these skills to complete initforthe's skills test:

"Our client uses subcontractors to perform a task. To ensure a timely response from the subcontractor, he needs to choose the closest subcontractor to the project at hand. Please build a small Rails app that demonstrates being able to search by postcode and radius, and responding with subcontractors that are within that radius, in order of distance.

Your solution can use any means you see fit, to best deliver the result that the client is after.

(This is not a real client request, but synonymous with those we do get, and is a simplification of an existing live project)

Please submit this back to me as a public github repository with any supporting documentation as an email attachment."
